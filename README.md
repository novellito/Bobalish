Welcome to Bobalish! - A web app made to help you manage the drinks you order at boba places. If catch yourself saying "what did I order from \_\_\_ again?" Or if you're adventurous and like trying every drink on the menu, this app can help make sure you don't get the same thing again. Want to explore new places around? This app lets you do that!

This app was made to expose me to more Angular development (because alot of my work is in React ðŸ˜…)
